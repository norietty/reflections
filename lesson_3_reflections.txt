You want to use a remote repository if you want to collaborate with others on a poroject  or you want to store a version of your work remotly 
or show your work to other people 

you might want to manually pull changes to have more control on what changes are added to your 
local repository especially  if you're collaborating with other people online. 

Clone give a copy of the repository and can be done in github or locally, as for clone it's done only
on github and it's for having a repo you can change and let other people make changes to it.As for branches 
it acts on the same repository and it's for testing or experimenting with new features. 

One benefit of having the latest copy of the remote is being up to date with the latest changes in the remote.
other benefits include having the latest changes in case the services goes down for some reason 

I think collaborating with git and github make collaboration is for people without them it'll  be 
much harder. I think sharing file will be difficult and also reviewing code and other things it's hard to think 
of something will be easy without git and github other then not having to learn them.

I think making new branches for changes make a lot secure to trie new things and new ideas and make sure 
that the master stays safe from possibilities of corruption but it gets heavy with a lot of merging and 
creating new branches so definitely will be slower then working directly on the master branch.

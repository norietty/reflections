when you first create a repository  hidden file are created for you by git 
these file will be used to track changes in the repository if you don't init 
a repo git will not be able to track these changes.

The staging area is different  from the repo because it's keep track of the changes 
you want to make to the repo and gives more control on how the changes  to be made to the repo
. it differ from the working directory because it's not permanent.

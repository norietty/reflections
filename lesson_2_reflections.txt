when you first create a repository  hidden file are created for you by git 
these file will be used to track changes in the repository if you don't init 
a repo git will not be able to track these changes.

The staging area is different  from the repo because it's keep track of the changes 
you want to make to the repo and gives more control on how the changes  to be made to the repo
. it differ from the working directory because it's not permanent.

In the staging area we add the changes we want to make to the repo the staging area help 
us track the changes we anat to make and separate these changes.

Branching help test new feature and ideas without messing up working version of the code which 
can be useful, also you can test other version of your app.

Diagram help visualize the branches by showing what commits are in each branch
and when the branching happened 

The result of merging two branches is a new branch contains new commits from the two branches 
, and we represents it in diagram so we can easily find in which branch commits are made and how 
these changes came about.
